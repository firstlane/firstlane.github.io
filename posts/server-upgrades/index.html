In a previous post, I wrote about a Discord bot I wrote to allow me to start and shutdown my server easily. The motivation for this was that the server was loud, and in my bedroom. I wanted to be able to shut it down easily if I was laying in bed and ready to fall asleep.</p><p>This functionality is useful, but it defeats the purpose of having a server. They&rsquo;re typically meant to run 24/7. Also, I&rsquo;ve been looking at setting up a backup solution using rsync or borg, and the first backup is likely to take hours. I don&rsquo;t want to turn off the server in the middle of the night when it might be running a backup.</p><p>I started looking at where else I could put my server. The only place that made sense was in the room outside my bedroom. It would be within reach of my modem so I could hardwire it. The only issue was my cat. He likes to chew through wires, and has damaged a decent amount of equipment in the past. I looked at enclosures online but thought they were too pricey. However, I came across some DIY server rack builds and thought it looked like a fun project. And so, I set out to build my own enclosure.</p><p>I started by taking a reference image from online and modeled it in Blender, using the dimensions of my computer for reference. I wanted the enclosure to comfortably hold my computer, while also having some extra storage for a couple of Raspberry Pis, a network switch, etc. I ended up modeling a small shelf above the computer to hold those items. You can see the model below.</p><p>After I was satisfied with the model, I wrote up a list of materials I&rsquo;d need from Home Depot and got everything purchased. After that, I spent the weekend cutting wood, drilling holes, and putting the enclosure together.</p><p>I initially wanted to do a clear acrylic panel for the front door of the enclosure. I had thought of putting some LED strips or a smart color bulb inside the rack, and I wanted to be able to see them nice and clear. When I got to this part of the build, I was sorely disappointed. I didn&rsquo;t have proper tools to cut acrylic, and the panel ended up getting cracked in multiple places. It was essentially useless at that point, since I didn&rsquo;t want to have myself or my cats cutting ourselves on the enclosure. For future reference, use a circular saw for cutting acrylic, not a hand blade :)</p><p>I settled on using some leftover MDF board for the door. The last touch was adding some cage wire around the enclosure openings. I decided to go with this instead of more MDF boards to allow air into the enclosure. The wire would definitely be strong enough to keep my cats out.</p><p>After getting the enclosure setup in my house and the computer moved inside it, I ran some ethernet cable in conduit to keep it protected and got everything fired up. My bedroom is now silent when I go to sleep, and I have a server running 24/7.</p></div><div class=pagination><a href=/posts/server-bot/ class="left arrow">&#8592;</a>
