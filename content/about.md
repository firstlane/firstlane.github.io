Hi, I'm Thompson. I'm just a guy who enjoys learning and trying out new technology. I'm pretty decent with C++, and I've been working on learning Rust and Go. Writing custom tools for personal use is my guilty pleasure.

If I sink enough time into something and feel like I have something worth writing about, you'll find a post for it on this site. Hopefully some of it can be helpful to others, in the same way that many posts on the web have been helpful to me.
